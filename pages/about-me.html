                <p>
                    Weâ€™ve designed this website to help improve the functionality and work flow of cities and urban environments all across America. We care about being able to make it more accessible for you to be able to file a city concern and know that it is going to be sent off to the correct member of City Hall. Because being able to improving the city for everyone to travel in is extremely important but it can be difficult to find every possible problem. This will be a tool for citizens to aid in that process by properly filing a city condition. If multiple reports come in for a single issue than that will help highlight the importance of the issue but no matter what each report will be viewed and processed.
                    <br>
                    On the other side of this website City Hall will be able to more easily manage and sort through all reports in order to task them to the proper work force. They will also be able to know and update the status of each report and be able to fix the concern in an expedited fashion.
                    <br>    
                    With your help we can improve cities nationwide!
